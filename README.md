# ShoppingCalculator
I add some features: total price, you saved, totally saved and shopping history. Once you submit the info of
your shopping item, it will be shown in history record meanwhile the value of total price and totally saved
will be changed. Once you want to clear the info you are typing, you can click clear.
Also I use the stack view for this app to make it fit all orientation.
